# Creative Coding Assignment: Sun and Moon Rotation

This is an assignment for my course in TADT/BIFE.

## Using Timelines for Sun and Moon Rotation

In this update, I have created a day-night cycle effect by rotating the Sun and Moon using a timeline in Unreal Engine's Blueprint system.

### Details of the Blueprint Logic

- **Event Begin Play**: Starts the timeline to control Sun and Moon rotation as soon as the level begins.
- **Sun and Moon Actors**: 
  - The timeline updates the rotation of both the Sun and Moon actors to create the effect of them moving across the sky.
  - The `Set Actor Rotation` nodes apply the rotation values generated by the timeline.
- **Continuous Update**: The rotation values are updated continuously based on the timeline to simulate a smooth, natural movement. 

This README provides an overview of how the Sun and Moon rotation is implemented, along with potential improvements to make the scene more immersive.
